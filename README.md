## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript

### What I learned

- While working on this project, I create an infinite loop that made me force shutdown my system. I learned to be careful with my Loops.
- How to style the hr tag.
- In my last project [Unit Converter](https://aphatheology.github.io/UnitConverter/), all colors and background colors stated in hsl were not working, Chrome is giving an error of invalid color code (I resolved to using their rgb equivalent). I learnt the cause of that in this project. 
  hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
  hue is between 0 - 360 and does not require a % at the front, I was adding % to my hue values which is causing the error.
  Saturation and Lightness are between 0 - 100 and requires % in front of them.



### Continued development

- I will work on allowing user to specify their password range - **DONE!!! ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ**
- I will work on allowing user copy and of the password generated.
- I will work on making the project a PWA
-If you have any suggestion on what to add, kindly send a message through the links below. Thanks
